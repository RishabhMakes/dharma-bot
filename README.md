# dharma-bot
Making a fun little bot that replicates our beloved department pet's behaviour on Discord:
- Hangs out in different channels 🐕
- Blesses users with GIF goodness on being called a Good girl 🐶
- If you have a 🍕, it comes pleading 🥺
- 💩 on your messages if she doesn't like you

## Setup
- Clone the repository with `git clone` or through a GUI like Github Desktop
- Set your `prefix`, `token` and `giphy_key` in the `config.json` file.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `node index.js` to start the bot.
